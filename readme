Welcome!

The Fantasy Football League of Superb Champions II or (or FFLSCII for short) is currently a
private fantasy football league. What makes this league special? Well commercial college
football leagues don't exist. This league is an adaptation of NFL fantasy football for college
(without any betting). It employs several college specific rules to make competition competitive.

This endeavor began as a fun side project managed with Excel VBA scripts. It has morphed into
much more than that. All of the backend code is written in Python and replaced all of the
original VBA scripts.

My next goal is to launch a custom website to replace the shared Google Doc currently
serving as our frontend.
