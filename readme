The fantasy football program is intended to be both an avenue to learn and an automation of a laborious process.

I am using this project to learn more about Python and programming in general. At work I develop solutions 
for a delivered (COTS) product, Since this application is entirely custom here are many challenges and design
decisions to make that I don't encounter at work.

This application will replace my spreadsheet based fantasy football league. Previously I used Excel VBA
to calculate points and monitor stats for each team. I pulled stats manually. This program will automate
those tasks.

At a minimum the application will:
--Retrieve player stats from espn via web scraping
--Maintain a database of those stats
--Capture teams
--Capture weekly lineups
--Allocate points based on player performance
--Track (display?) standings 

Stretch goals:
--Track stats real time
--Capture or run draft
