# Outline for saving player data

# Table structure
#  table for each player
# Should table have columns unique to player position or contain all possible columns?
#  Original excel sheets was agnostic of player position

# So a player table should include the following columns:
#  Date  |  Opponent  |  Result  |  Completions  |  Pass Att  |  Pas  Yards  |  Completion %  |  Longest Pass Play
#  Passing TDs  |  Interceptions Thrown  |  Passer Rating  |  Raw QBR  |  Adj QBR
#  Rushing Att  |  Rush Yards  |  Rush Avg  |  Rush Long  |  Rush TD 
#  Receptions  |  Rec Yards  | Rec Avg  |  Rec long  |  Rec TD
#  FG 1-19  |  FG 20-29  |  FG 30-39  |  FG 40-49  |  FG 50+  |  FG Made  |  FG %  |  FG Long
#  Extra Points Made  |  XP Att  |  Points
